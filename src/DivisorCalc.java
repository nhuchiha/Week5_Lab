			define a static method called gcd that accepts two integers, num1 and num2. Create a driver
			program inside the main method to test your implementation. The recursive algorithm is
			defined as follows:
			gcd(num1, num2) is num2 if num2 <= num1 and num2 divides num1
			gcd(num1, num2) is gcd(num2, num1) if num1 < num2
			gcd(num1, num2) is gcd(num2, num1%num2) otherwise
